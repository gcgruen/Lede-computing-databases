Took me ages to figure out the answer to the genre-count question and I wish I came up with the solution Mercy figured, without using Counter.
Also TAs, at some point I have two answers for the same question (number 6), because first I did it by copy pasting the code I wrote and just altering the artist's name and felt that there must be an easier way. Soma then explained in Lab how to write functions, so I rewrote my code using a function. I left my initial coded answer in, for my own reference -- you can just ignore the first answer, if you like (also left comments on this along the notebook)
