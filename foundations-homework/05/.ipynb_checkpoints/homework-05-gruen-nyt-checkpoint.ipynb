    "1) What books topped the Hardcover Fiction NYT best-sellers list on Mother's Day in 2009 and 2010? How about Father's Day?\n",
    "\n",
    "2) What are all the different book categories the NYT ranked in June 6, 2009? How about June 6, 2015?\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Muammar Gaddafi's name can be transliterated many many ways. His last name is often a source of a million and one versions - Gadafi, Gaddafi, Kadafi, and Qaddafi to name a few. How many times has the New York Times referred to him by each of those names?\n",
    "\n",
    "Tip: Add \"Libya\" to your search to make sure (-ish) you're talking about the right guy.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) What's the title of the first story to mention the word 'hipster' in 1995? What's the first paragraph?\n",
    "\n",
    "5) How many times was gay marriage mentioned in the NYT between 1950-1959, 1960-1969, 1970-1978, 1980-1989, 1990-2099, 2000-2009, and 2010-present?\n",

    "Tip: You'll want to put quotes around the search term so it isn't just looking for \"gay\" and \"marriage\" in the same article.\n",

    "6) What section talks about motorcycles the most?\n",

    "Tip: You'll be using facets\n",
    "\n",
    "7) How many of the last 20 movies reviewed by the NYT were Critics' Picks? How about the last 40? The last 60?\n",
    "\n",
    "Tip: You really don't want to do this 3 separate times (1-20, 21-40 and 41-60) and add them together. What if, perhaps, you were able to figure out how to combine two lists? Then you could have a 1-20 list, a 1-40 list, and a 1-60 list, and then just run similar code for each of them.\n",

    "8) Out of the last 40 movie reviews from the NYT, which critic has written the most reviews?"
